# Interactive Game Poster for Vis Com

## Instructions
When you load the page, there will be a black screen. Press ENTER on your keyboard. After the background scrolls and when the mountains pop up, you can move your character. Press A to move left, D to move right, and SPACE to jump. Press J to dash. Dashing works best while moving in the air. Collect all the strawberries and the title will be revealed.

## Features
* Scrolling background
* Sounds (from the game: Celeste)
* Parallaxing
* Controllable Character

## Design Goals
My idea was to have a poster, have it present to you by pressing buttons and doing certain actions on the screen in order to unlock more of the poster. I wanted it to be partly a game to interact with the poster, but not entirely a poster with a game behind it. Then that would just be a regular game, not an interactive poster. For the playable character, I wanted to be able to try to mimic the platformer aspect of the original game, so I added acceleration, jumping, and dashing, just like what was in the original game.

## Credits
Sound effects and music from Celeste. Sprites and artwork created based off of the game, but not copied.
